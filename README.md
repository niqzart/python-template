# Python Template
A template repository for python projects with:
- Poetry
- Linters (flake8, wemake-style-guide, mypy)
- Formatters (black, autoflake)
- Pre-commit
- Pytest

### How to use
Click "use this template" on the top right of the main repository page and create a new repository from this one. After that you can work on your new repository as usual. I'd recommend searching all `change this` comments in `pyproject.toml` and changing those lines to whatever you seem fit

### Install
```
pip install poetry
poetry install
pre-commit install
```
